# üìò RISC-V Pipelined Processor ‚Äì Technical Q&A

Welcome to the technical documentation for my 5-stage **RISC-V Pipelined Processor**. This README addresses key design choices, implementation details, and verification strategies in a Q&A format to offer deep insight into the architecture.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

### 1. What are the key differences between RISC-V and traditional CISC architectures?

| Feature         | RISC-V                           | CISC (e.g., x86)                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Instruction Set | Simple & modular                 | Complex with varied lengths            |
| Length          | Fixed 32-bit                     | Variable (1‚Äì15 bytes)                  |
| Memory Access   | Load/store only                  | Memory access in arithmetic ops        |
| Pipeline        | Easier to implement              | Complex due to instruction decoding    |

---

### 2. What are the advantages of using a load-store architecture?

- Simplifies instruction decoding
- Improves pipeline throughput
- Enables parallelism with fewer data hazards
- Promotes compiler optimization

---

### 3. Describe the purpose of each pipeline stage.

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **IF** (Instruction Fetch)     | Fetch the next instruction from memory |
| **ID** (Instruction Decode)    | Decode instruction and read registers |
| **EX** (Execute)               | Perform ALU operations / branch decision |
| **MEM** (Memory Access)        | Read/write data memory |
| **WB** (Write Back)            | Write result back to register file |

---

### 4. How is the fixed-length 32-bit instruction format handled?

- Uniform decoding logic
- Reduces complexity in control unit
- Aligns naturally with 32-bit word boundaries
- Enhances predictability for pipelining

---

## üßÆ Register File

### 5. Why does RISC-V have 32 general-purpose registers?

- Efficient instruction execution
- Fewer memory accesses
- Balanced performance vs. hardware cost
- Enables fast context switching

---

### 6. Why is `x0` hardwired to zero?

- Always returns 0
- Helps in instruction simplification
- Useful in conditional checks and resets

---

### 7. How does the register file handle simultaneous read/write?

- Dual read ports and one write port
- Read and write occur in the same clock cycle
- Write occurs on positive clock edge, avoiding collision

---

### 8. What are the trade-offs in your register file design?

| Factor   | Trade-Off |
|----------|-----------|
| Area     | Extra ports increase silicon usage |
| Speed    | Access time increases with register count |
| Complexity | Read-write conflict management required |

---

## üì• Instruction Processing

### üîç Decoding

### 9. How are control signals generated for different instructions?

- Opcode-driven decoding logic
- Generates ALUOp, MemRead, MemWrite, RegWrite, Branch
- Uses opcode + funct3/funct7 for fine control

---

### 10. How is immediate value extracted for various formats?

| Format | Bits Used |
|--------|-----------|
| I-type | [31:20] (sign-extended) |
| S-type | [31:25] & [11:7] |
| B-type | [31], [7], [30:25], [11:8] |
| U-type | [31:12] shifted left |
| J-type | [20], [10:1], [11], [19:12] |

---

### 11. How are `funct3` and `funct7` used in ALU control?

- `funct3` selects basic operation
- `funct7` distinguishes between operations like `ADD`/`SUB`, `SLL`/`SRL`
- Combined logic maps to ALU operation

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Execution

### 12. Describe your ALU and supported operations.

- Arithmetic: ADD, SUB
- Logical: AND, OR, XOR
- Shift: SLL, SRL, SRA
- Comparison: SLT, SLTU
- Modular design with operation selector

---

### 13. How do you handle arithmetic overflow?

- Overflow is not trapped (RISC-V spec)
- Overflow detection is available via sign bit logic
- Software handles exceptional cases

---

### 14. Explain your branch comparison logic.

- Signed/unsigned comparators
- Output condition flag for branch decision
- Combined with PC logic to update on true condition

---

### 15. ALU datapath optimizations?

- Forwarding paths to reduce hazards
- Minimal combinational delay
- Operation selector to avoid redundant logic

---

## üß± Memory System

### 16. What were your memory hierarchy design choices?

- Single unified memory for simplicity
- Word-aligned memory with byte addressing
- Scalable for future cache integration

---

### 17. How is byte-addressable memory handled?

---

### 18. Describe your load/store execution pipeline.

- **EX Stage:** Address generation
- **MEM Stage:** Memory read/write
- **WB Stage:** Write to register for loads

---

### 19. What hazards exist in your memory system?

- Load-use hazard: Requires pipeline stall
- Memory access delays: Managed via control
- Structural hazards avoided via separate I/D memory (Harvard style)

---

---

### 21. How do you handle data hazards?

- Forwarding from EX/MEM, MEM/WB
- Load-use stalls inserted using hazard detection logic
- Ensures correct execution without corruption

---

### 22. Control hazard solutions?

- Static branch prediction (assume not taken)
- Flush IF/ID and ID/EX on wrong prediction
- PC updated only on branch resolution

---

### 23. What forwarding paths are implemented?

- EX-to-EX: For immediate-use instructions
- MEM-to-EX: For load dependencies
- Reduces stalls and boosts pipeline throughput

---

### 24. Describe your stall logic for load-use.

- Detects destination register from MEM stage
- Compares with source registers in ID stage
- Inserts bubble in EX stage to delay instruction

---

## üß™ Verification & Testing

### 25. What verification method was used?

- Directed and random tests in Verilog
- Functional coverage using assertion monitors
- Debug via waveform tools (e.g., GTKWave)

---

### 26. How were instruction types tested?

- Each instruction type tested individually
- Integration tests for multiple instructions in sequence
- Edge-value tests for zero, overflow, max/min values

---

### 27. How were pipeline hazards debugged?

- Monitored pipeline registers at each cycle
- Injected NOPs to isolate hazard behavior
- Used waveform markers for tracking instruction flow

---

### 28. Edge condition test cases?

- Writing to x0 (should ignore)
- Overflow in arithmetic
- Branches at boundary conditions
- Load/store misalignment detection

## üìà Performance Analysis

### 29. How is CPI calculated?

```markdown
CPI = Total Cycles / Number of Instructions
```

- Measured over long-running programs
- Ideal CPI: ~1.1 with basic forwarding and stalls

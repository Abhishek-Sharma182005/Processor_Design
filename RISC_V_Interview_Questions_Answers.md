## üöÄ Architecture & Design

### 1. **Key Differences Between RISC-V and CISC Architectures**
RISC-V follows the **Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)** philosophy, offering:
- Fewer, simpler instructions
- Uniform instruction length (32-bit)
- Load-store architecture

Whereas **CISC (e.g., x86)** uses:
- Complex instructions with varying lengths
- Memory operations within arithmetic instructions  
RISC-V simplifies decoding and improves pipelining efficiency.

### 2. **Advantages of Load-Store Architecture**
- Simplifies the instruction set
- Makes pipeline implementation more straightforward
- Reduces memory access conflicts
- Promotes higher instruction throughput

### 3. **Pipeline Stages in Our Implementation**
1. **IF (Instruction Fetch):** Fetch instruction from memory
2. **ID (Instruction Decode):** Decode instruction and read registers
3. **EX (Execute):** Perform ALU operations or branch calculations
4. **MEM (Memory Access):** Access memory for load/store
5. **WB (Write Back):** Write results to the register file

### 4. **Handling Fixed-Length 32-bit Instructions**
Each instruction is 32-bits wide, allowing:
- Simplified decoding logic
- Predictable instruction boundaries
- Better support for pipelining and parallelism

## üßÆ Register File

### 5. **Why 32 General-Purpose Registers?**
- Offers a balance between speed and hardware cost
- Reduces frequent memory access
- Encourages compiler efficiency
- Aligns with the RISC philosophy

### 6. **Significance of `x0` Hardwired to Zero**
- Always outputs zero
- Prevents accidental changes
- Useful for conditional operations, address manipulation, and clearing registers

### 7. **Handling Simultaneous Read/Write**
- Dual-port read and single-port write logic
- Writes occur on the rising edge of the clock
- Reads happen in the same cycle but on separate ports

### 8. **Trade-offs in Register File Design**
| Aspect | Trade-Off |
|--------|-----------|
| Area   | Dual-read ports increase silicon usage |
| Speed  | More registers = longer access time |
| Complexity | Simultaneous operations need conflict resolution |

## üß† Instruction Processing

### üîç Decoding

### 9. **Control Signal Generation**
The Control Unit decodes the opcode to generate:
- ALU control signals
- Memory read/write enables
- Branch and register write enables

### 10. **Immediate Value Extraction Logic**
Supports:
- I-type: Sign-extend bits [31:20]
- S-type: Concatenate [31:25] & [11:7]
- B-type: Bit shifting and sign-extension
- U-type & J-type: Custom extraction logic to maintain sign integrity

### 11. **Handling `funct3` and `funct7`**
- `funct3` selects ALU operation
- `funct7` distinguishes operations like `ADD` vs `SUB`
- A multiplexer selects the correct ALU function based on both fields

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Execution

### 12. **ALU Design & Operations**
Supports:
- Arithmetic (ADD, SUB, MUL)
- Logic (AND, OR, XOR)
- Shift (SLL, SRL, SRA)
- Comparison (SLT, SLTU)
Implemented as a modular unit with an operation selector.

### 13. **Handling Arithmetic Overflow**
- Flags not stored like in x86
- Overflow detected via MSB carry/borrow logic
- Behavior controlled by the application-level logic

### 14. **Branch Comparison Logic**
- Uses signed/unsigned comparators
- Outputs a branch decision flag to the control unit
- Combined with PC update logic in the EX stage

### 15. **ALU Datapath Optimizations**
- Operand forwarding to reduce stalls
- Multiplexed inputs to support multiple instruction types
- Pipeline-aware arithmetic unit with low-latency paths

---

## üß± Memory System

### 16. **Memory Hierarchy Design**
- Simple single-level data memory
- Supports byte, half-word, word accesses
- Easily extendable to instruction/data cache later

### 17. **Byte-Addressable Memory Handling**
- Word-aligned memory model (32-bit)
- Uses byte enable signals to access specific bytes
- Aligns with RISC-V load/store encoding

### 18. **Load/Store Pipeline Stages**
- Load: Memory read in MEM, data forwarded to WB
- Store: Address and data computed in EX, written in MEM

### 19. **Potential Hazards**
- Load-Use hazard: Requires stall or forwarding
- Memory latency: Introduces timing mismatches
- Store-after-load conflicts: Resolved via control logic

## üèóÔ∏è Pipeline Implementation

### 20. **Pipeline Registers**
| Register | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| IF/ID    | Holds fetched instruction & PC |
| ID/EX    | Holds decoded signals & register values |
| EX/MEM   | Holds ALU result, branch flag |
| MEM/WB   | Holds data from memory or ALU to write back |

### 21. **Data Hazards Handling**
- Forwarding from EX/MEM and MEM/WB
- Stall logic for load-use cases
- Pipeline interlock for safe execution

### 22. **Control Hazard Handling**
- Branch prediction (static ‚Äì not taken)
- Flush pipeline if prediction is wrong
- PC updated with new branch target

### 23. **Forwarding Paths**
- EX ‚Üí EX: For immediate next-use cases
- MEM ‚Üí EX: For load data forwarding
Reduces pipeline stalls and improves IPC.

### 24. **Stall Logic for Load-Use**
- Detects dependency in ID stage
- Inserts a NOP between load and use
- Controlled via pipeline stall signal

## üîç Verification & Testing

### 25. **Verification Methodology**
- Testbench with directed and random testcases
- Waveform analysis using GTKWave/Vivado
- Coverage tracking for instruction formats

### 26. **Instruction Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for each instruction category
- Edge cases (zero, max, min values)
- Combined scenarios for multi-instruction behavior

### 27. **Debugging Pipeline Hazards**
- Signal tracing between stages
- Monitoring pipeline register contents
- Logging hazard detection/stall/forward signals

### 28. **Edge Condition Test Cases**
- Register `x0` writes
- Overflow and underflow values
- Back-to-back branching and load-store scenarios

---

## üìä Performance Analysis

### 29. **Calculating CPI**
\[
\text{CPI} = \frac{\text{Total Clock Cycles}}{\text{Total Instructions Executed}}
\]
- Measured over multiple programs
- Ideal CPI ~1, varies with stalls/hazards

### 30. **Critical Paths**
- Register file ‚Üí ALU ‚Üí MEM ‚Üí WB
- Branch decision logic in EX stage
- Load-store memory access latency

## Microarchitecture Design

### 51. How would you redesign your datapath to support out-of-order execution?
To support Out-of-Order (OoO) execution, you'd need to decouple instruction fetch/decode from execution. This means introducing:
- **Reservation stations**: Temporarily hold instructions until operands are ready.
- **Reorder buffer (ROB)**: Maintains program order for commits.
- **Register renaming**: Avoids false dependencies.
These changes allow independent instructions to execute in parallel, improving performance.

### 52. Describe three different approaches to implement branch prediction in your design
1. **Static Prediction**: Predict backward branches as taken and forward as not-taken.
2. **1-bit Dynamic Prediction**: Use a single bit to record the last outcome.
3. **2-bit Saturating Counter**: More accurate by requiring two mispredictions to change direction.

### 53. What techniques would you use to reduce pipeline bubbles in your implementation?
- **Forwarding (Bypassing)**
- **Out-of-order execution**
- **Branch prediction**
- **Speculative execution**
These prevent the pipeline from stalling when data dependencies or branches occur.

### 54. How would you add scoreboarding to your current design?
Scoreboarding keeps track of instruction dependencies and resource usage. You'd need to:

It enables dynamic scheduling without register renaming.

### 55. Explain how register renaming could be implemented in your processor

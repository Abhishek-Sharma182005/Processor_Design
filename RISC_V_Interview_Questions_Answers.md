# RISC-V 32-bit Processor Interview Questions and Answers

## Processor Architecture
### Fundamentals
1. **Explain the key differences between RISC-V and traditional CISC architectures**  
   RISC-V is a load-store, open-source, reduced instruction set architecture (RISC), offering simplicity, modularity, and scalability. CISC (e.g., x86) has complex instructions, more addressing modes, and varied instruction lengths.

2. **What are the advantages of using a load-store architecture?**  
   It simplifies instruction decoding, enables pipelining, and improves performance due to separate memory and computation instructions.

3. **Describe the purpose of each pipeline stage in your implementation**  
   - IF (Instruction Fetch): Fetches instruction from memory.  
   - ID (Instruction Decode): Decodes instruction and reads registers.  
   - EX (Execute): ALU operations and address calculations.  
   - MEM (Memory Access): Data memory read/write.  
   - WB (Write Back): Writes results back to registers.

4. **How does your design handle the fixed-length 32-bit instruction format?**  
   It simplifies instruction decoding and pipeline design by standardizing the parsing logic across all stages.

### Register File
5. **Why does RISC-V have 32 general-purpose registers?**  
   It provides a balance between performance and resource usage, supporting efficient compiler usage.

6. **Explain the significance of register x0 being hardwired to zero**  
   x0 simplifies many operations (e.g., MOV, branch conditions) and avoids unnecessary instructions.

7. **How does your register file implementation handle simultaneous read/write operations?**  
   Dual-port read and single-port write structure with synchronous clocking ensures reliable operation.

8. **What are the trade-offs in your register file design?**  
   - Area vs. performance: More ports increase area.  
   - Timing: Larger register files may slow down access time.

## Instruction Processing
### Decoding
9. **How does your control unit generate signals for different instruction types?**  
   Based on opcode, funct3, and funct7 fields, it uses combinational logic to drive control signals.

10. **Explain your immediate value extraction logic for various instruction formats**  
   Uses dedicated logic to extract and sign-extend immediate fields depending on format (I, S, B, U, J).

11. **How do you handle the different funct3 and funct7 fields for ALU operations?**  
   A control decoder maps these to specific ALU operations using a lookup or case statement.

### Execution
12. **Describe your ALU design and supported operations**  
   ALU supports arithmetic, logic, shifts, comparisons, and is controlled by ALU control signals.

13. **How do you handle arithmetic overflow in your implementation?**  
   Overflow flags are monitored and optionally trapped based on mode or ignored in unsigned ops.

14. **Explain your branch comparison logic and how condition codes are generated**  
   Comparators check equality, less-than, or greater-than using register values; no separate flags needed.

15. **What optimizations did you implement in the ALU datapath?**  
   - One-hot muxing for inputs
